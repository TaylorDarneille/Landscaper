LANDSCAPER DELIVERABLE 

app must have:
1. ability to take user input -- prompt
2. ability for user to earn money -- money declared as a variable 
3. ability to buy tools -- every tool declared as a variable (in case we do the bonus challenge)
4. ability to win the game and end it -- conditional statement if user has certain amount of money AND certain tool, game ends and prompt ends

THOUGHTS

while loop? so the prompt keeps going until a certain condition is met -- if money is NOT $1000 and team is equal to 0 or less 

VARIABLES

* numbers:
money = 0 
scissors = 0
oldLawnmower = 0
newLawnmower = 0
team = 0

* booleans:
hasScissors = false
hasOldLawnmower = false
hasNewLawnmower = false 
hasTeam = false 

* arrays:
tools = []
